# Luminary-Auras-Reffect
A more visible UI element for Guardian's Luminary Elite Specialization

This pack contains two main elements:
- Tracks Luminary's blessing.
- If Sovereign of Light is equipped, additionally tracks Light Aura, so you know when to detonate it.
  This icon has a diamond shape like pages or a round shape more closely similar to the light aura itself, so you can choose whichever one you prefer.

Additionally, turns the separator between F3 and F4 black to be consistent with other elite specs.

# Notes

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.
